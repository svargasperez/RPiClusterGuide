# How to Build a Low-Cost HPC Cluster

This guide is the result of an independent study performed by [Nathan H. Silverman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathan-silverman-b35767173/), a  [Kalamazoo College](https://www.kzoo.edu)'s student in Computer Science, under the supervision of Sandino Vargas-Pérez. For questions, please contact Dr. Vargas-Pérez via [E-mail](mailto:sandino.vargasperez@kzoo.edu)

## About the Guide

The guide was designed to build a cluster using 4 Raspberry Pi (RPi) computers, but it can be used to build a cluster of any size. The step-by-step instructions will detail how to assemble hardware, configure software, and the setup needed to have a fully functioning RPi cluster. Raspberry Pi 3 B+s were used for this project, although with a few tweaks, any modern RPi should work.
